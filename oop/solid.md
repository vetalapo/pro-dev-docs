# S.O.L.I.D

# S - Single Responsibility
One Thing - One class

# O - Open Close principle
Open for extension, closed for modification

# L  - Liskov Substitution Principle
Methods and properties should behave in the same way for root and derived classes. In such way that you can replace root class with any of its children without changing the behavior.

# I - Interface Segregation Principle
A lot of small interfaces is better than big one. 

# D - Dependency Inversion Principle
Dependencies should be based on abstractions (abstract classes or interfaces or base classes)
